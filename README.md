# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, as used on my Mac mini computer (and using SSH on my iPad).

- Git configuration (this has my email/name, so don't just copy this file), and ignores file
- TMUX configuration
- ZSH configuration
- Neovim configuration (requires Packer, installed separately)
- Script to make backups of my files to ZIP archives
- Script to connect to my bastion server and open remote ports
- Script to copy config files to this repository automatically
